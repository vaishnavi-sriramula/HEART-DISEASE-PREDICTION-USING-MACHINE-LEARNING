# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Overview

This project is a Heart Disease Prediction System developed using machine learning. The system predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs related to various health parameters. The model used for prediction is trained on a heart disease dataset and can help in early detection and prevention.

Features

User-friendly GUI for inputting health parameters.

Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs.

Provides clear results indicating whether there is a possibility of heart disease or not.


Requirements
Python 3.x
tkinter
joblib
Scikit-learn

Health Parameters

The following health parameters need to be entered:

Age
Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
CP (Chest Pain type)
Trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure)
Chol (Serum Cholesterol)
Fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl, 1 = True, 0 = False)
Restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic results)
Thalach (Maximum Heart Rate achieved)
Exang (Exercise Induced Angina, 1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
Slope (Slope of the peak exercise ST segment)
CA (Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy)
Thal (Thalassemia)
